# App profitability in Apple App Store and Google Play Store

For this project I assume that I'm working for a company making mobile apps for iOS and Android devices, placing them in AppStore and Play Store storefronts respectively. Apps are offered for free for an english speaking audience and our main revenue is through advertisements placed in the app. App profitability is closely tied with the number of users the app has. Goal of this excersise is to determine which apps tend to be the most profitable and are likely to succeed in the future.

This project was done in Python without any data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn etc.) as an experiment.
